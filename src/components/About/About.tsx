        Hi, I’m Nicolas Pereira, a web developer with a background in QA and a
        passion for building efficient, user-friendly solutions. I’m pursuing a
        degree in Computer Engineering and have worked on diverse projects, from
        personal tools like a financial tracking app to 3D applications using
        OpenGL.
      </p>

        I specialize in TypeScript and React. I’m always eager to learn and take
        on new challenges. Let’s create something amazing together!
